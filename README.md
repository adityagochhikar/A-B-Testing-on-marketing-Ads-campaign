# 📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis

# 🏆 Project Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign data to uncover key insights on ad effectiveness, optimal timing, and actionable strategies for maximizing conversions.

# 🔍 Key Insights

1️⃣ Ad Exposure & Effectiveness

✅ Ads outperform PSAs – Advertisements drive significantly more conversions than public service announcements.

✅ Higher exposure = higher conversions – Users who see more ads are more likely to purchase.

✅ Optimal ad range – Between 250-749 ads maximize conversions without overwhelming users.

# 2️⃣ Best Timing for Campaigns

📅 Best Day – Monday sees the highest conversion rates.

⏰ Best Time – 16:00 performs best, with 14:00-20:00 also showing strong results.

📊 Day-Hour Interaction – While Monday at 16:00 is optimal, Saturday at 05:00 also shows surprising success.

# 🎯 Actionable Recommendations

✔ Focus on Mondays – Allocate a significant portion of the budget to this high-converting day.

✔ Leverage late afternoons & evenings – Run ads between 14:00-20:00, with a priority on 16:00.


# ⚠️ Limitations

⚡ Data Constraints – Missing factors like demographics & ad content quality.

⚡ Imbalance in Group Sizes – More users saw ads than PSAs, potentially influencing results.

⚡ Assumption of Consistency – Behavior changes over time may impact findings.

# 📌 Conclusion

This analysis provides a data-driven strategy for optimizing marketing campaigns by balancing ad exposure and timing. Further studies with diverse datasets can refine these insights for even greater impact.
